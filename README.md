Mod for Lethal Company, that allow adjusting percentage of votes required for the ship to leave.

Ever had one dead player triggering Ship to Leave Early, while all other players a perfectly fine and wanna keep scavenging facility? Then this mod might solve this problem.

Now required amount of Votes for Ship to Leave Early will cound based on total amount of players in lobby instead of amount of dead players. Which would allow to adjust percentage of players. For example, it can be used to require 2 or 3 people voting, when playing in lobby with 4+ people.

All features enabled/disabled and values can be adjusted in Config.
