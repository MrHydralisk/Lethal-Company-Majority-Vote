# Majority Vote
Mod for Lethal Company, that allow adjusting percentage of votes required for the ship to leave.

Ever had one dead player triggering Ship to Leave Early, while all other players a perfectly fine and wanna keep scavenging facility? Then this mod might solve this problem.

Now required amount of Votes for Ship to Leave Early will count based on total amount of players in lobby instead of amount of dead players. Which would allow to adjust percentage of players. For example, it can be used to require 2 or 3 people voting, when playing in lobby with 4+ people.
# Features
- Adjustable percentage of all players in lobby who need to vote for Ship to Leave Early.
- Adjustable min/max amount of votes for too small or too big player count.

All features enabled/disabled and values can be adjusted in Config.
# Client/Server
Votes count functionality is fully Server-side, but Clients would need this mod too for proper value on HUD.
